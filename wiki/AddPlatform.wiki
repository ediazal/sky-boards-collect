1. *Platform firmware*

To define contiki-collect firmware for a platform, take {{{collect-view-sky.c}}} as reference.

Then edit {{{SensorInfo.java}}} to specify the platform message format.

See /svn/trunk/contiki/examples/ for examples

2. *Sensors classes*

A sensor class implements the sensor conversion expressions. See:

 * /svn/trunk/sky-boards-collect/src/se/sics/contiki/collect/sensor

Take existing sensor classes as reference.
----

3. *Platform class*

The platform class creates its sensors instances, and map the sensor identifiers to the specific collect message position. See:

 * /svn/trunk/sky-boards-collect/src/se/sics/contiki/collect/sensor

Take existing platform classes as reference. If a sensor that doesn't exist is introduced along with the defined platform, sensor identifier should be create in {{{SensorIdentifier.java}}}. eg:

{{{public static final String TILT_X_SENSOR = "Tilt X";}}}
