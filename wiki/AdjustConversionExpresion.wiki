#Calibration example wit "adjust conversion expressions" tool

= Introduction =

An example on how to calibre DS1000.Temperature sensor using the _adjust conversion expressions tool_.



= Step 1 =

First we must have a *reference device* that we know it shows the right temperature, for example our home thermometer. In this example, *real value is 30ยบ.*

So, we start a network collect, and our temperature values from node 3 are not calibrated:

In other words: *CONVERSION(adc_value)=24*, and it should be 30

= Step 2 =

We need to know ADC_VALUE. This is the output from ADC12 that a node sends to application. We can see this value in console.

To know which is the right column, we have to open "_SensorInfo.java_" class in text editor and look for TEMPERATURE:

{{{
  public static final int TEMPERATURE = 24;
}}}

*NOTE: Since version 1.1b, it is not necessary to look for adc_value in console... This value is shown in the app dialog* 

= Step 3 =

Then we have CONVERSION(adc_value)=24, and this is wrong according to our reference thermometer :(

 * Select node 3 and go to "Tools->Adjust conversion expressions>Temperature sensor"

 * Change values until *CONVERSION(2349)=30*

You should change preferably Vcc and/or Vref, if your batteries have some time or you don't know which Vref is using the firmware to configure ADC12 ref input.



By trial and error method we found a good value (you could also try a more advanced method based in ecuations resolution). In this example if we change Vcc to 2.66 it gives the good conversion

*NOTE:* MinX, MaxX and IncX values are only for visualization purposes, its value doesn't affect conversion!

Now, close adjust conversion expressions dialog and chart will be updated to the right values:
